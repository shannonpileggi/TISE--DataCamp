\frametitle{Purpose of reasearch project}

This summer I worked with Dr. Pileggi and improved upon the STAT 217 labs in R by creating
a supplimental online DataCamp course that accompanies the labs. 

\begin{itemize}
 \item<1-> Technology plays a huge role in statistics, and even introductory statistics courses are utilizing statistical software.
 \item<2-> Non-statistics major students have a lot of trouble with R because they've never seen anything like it.
 \item<3-> The previous STAT 217 pre-labs consisted of a lab manual and video. \textbf{Should i add more about previous pre-labs?}
 \item<4-> My job this summer was to convert the previous lab materials to an interactive online R programming course
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{What is DataCamp?}
\begin{itemize}
 \item<1-> interactive leaning tool; receive instant personalized feedback
 \item<2-> DataCamp is a web-based application, only need a web browser to access courses (no R installation required)- can be very helpful for intro stats 
 \item<3-> Similar to swirl, educators can create their own DataCamp courses or utilize the free existing courses 
 \item<4-> Free for academic groups 
 \item<5-> DataCamp can be linked to learning management systems, easy to track student progress
\end{itemize}
