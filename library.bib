A flipped classroom is a type of active learning where transmission of content occurs outside of the classroom environment and problem solving and learning activities become the focus of classroom time. This article reports on results of a study conducted in flipped and non-flipped Introductory Statistics classroom environments measuring student achievement in both classrooms on traditional assessments as well as measuring student attitudes toward the flipped classroom environment},

abstract = {Undergraduate statistics courses are perceived as challenging by both students and instructors. Students' attitudes, motivation, math anxiety, and preparedness can negatively impact the student and instructor experience and have the potential to negatively impact student learning. This article describes an attempt to address some of these challenges through structural and procedural changes to an undergraduate statistics course that is required for social science majors. The traditional lecture/homework structure of the course was ‘‘flipped'' so that the majority of basic knowledge acquisition moved out of the classroom, making room for interactive activities during class time. The described changes had a positive impact on students' attitudes toward the class and instructor as well as on students' performance in the class.},

@article{Horton2014,
abstract = {Statistics students need to develop the capacity to make sense of the staggering amount of information collected in our increasingly data-centered world. Data science is an important part of modern statistics, but our introductory and second statistics courses often neglect this fact. This paper discusses ways to provide a practical foundation for students to learn to "compute with data" as defined by Nolan and Temple Lang (2010), as well as develop "data habits of mind" (Finzer, 2013). We describe how introductory and second courses can integrate two key precursors to data science: the use of reproducible analysis tools and access to large databases. By introducing students to commonplace tools for data management, visualization, and reproducible analysis in data science and applying these to real-world scenarios, we prepare them to think statistically in the era of big data.},

@article{Baumer2014,
abstract = {Nolan and Temple Lang argue that "the ability to express statistical computations is an essential skill." A key related capacity is the ability to conduct and present data analysis in a way that another person can understand and replicate. The copy-and-paste workflow that is an artifact of antiquated user-interface design makes reproducibility of statistical analysis more difficult, especially as data become increasingly complex and statistical methods become increasingly sophisticated. R Markdown is a new technology that makes creating fully-reproducible statistical analysis simple and painless. It provides a solution suitable not only for cutting edge research, but also for use in an introductory statistics course. We present evidence that R Markdown can be used effectively in introductory statistics courses, and discuss its role in the rapidly-changing world of statistical computation.},

abstract = {A variety of gamification techniques from the literature are used in two college courses. Some techniques, such as an experience point-based system and leaderboards, proved confusing or frustrating, while other techniques, such as adding a meaningful narrative layer and allowing students to create their own learning paths, engaged students more deeply. In this article, the techniques used and the effects of each are explored and suggestions are provided for instructors considering adding game layers to the classroom. Introduction},

abstract = {AbstractModular programming is a development paradigm that emphasizes self-contained, flexible, and independent pieces of functionality. This practice allows new features to be seamlessly added when desired, and unwanted features to be removed, thus simplifying the user-facing view of the software. The recent rise of web-based software applications has presented new challenges for designing an extensible, modular software system. In this paper, we outline a framework for designing such a system, with a focus on reproducibility of the results. We present as a case study a Shiny-based web application called intRo, that allows the user to perform basic data analyses and statistical routines. Finally, we highlight some challenges we encountered, and how to address them, when combining modular programming concepts with reactive programming as used by Shiny.},

annote = {- Why technology should be integraged into introductory stats (they use 2 articles in blue)

- outlines a R Markdown lesson (with mosaic) for 1st week of class to expose students to real data and software. 

- They would advocate the use of these things, while other educators might want to teach stats with other functionalities of R. There is no one 'right way' to incorporate R in an intro statistics class but DataCamp allows educators to use what they think is best.

- intoducing this early will help lessen anxiety for new R users

- recomend using mosaic()

- For large classes, this is not feasible. Yes having a lot of in-person assistance is great but a lot of the time you don't have the resources. DataCamp allows you to customize automated feedback. When a student submits an incorrect answer, the system will tell the student what they are doing wrong. You can customize this message to give students little hints toward the correct answer or tell them what the right answer is.},

@article{Cobb2015,
abstract = {The last half-dozen years have seen The American Statistician publish well-argued and provocative calls to change our thinking about statistics and how we teach it, among them Brown and Kass (2009), Nolan and Temple-Lang (2010), and Legler et al. (2010). Within this past year, the ASA has issued a new and comprehensive set of guidelines for undergraduate programs (ASA 2014). Accepting (and applauding) all this as background, the current article argues the need to rethink our curriculum from the ground up, and offers five principles and two caveats intended to help us along the path toward a new synthesis. These principles and caveats rest on my sense of three parallel evolutions: the convergence of trends in the roles of mathematics, computation, and context within statistics education. These ongoing changes, together with the articles cited above and the seminal provocation by Leo Breiman (2001) call for a deep rethinking of what we teach to undergraduates. In particular, following Brown and Kass, we should put priority on two goals, to make fundamental concepts accessible and to minimize prerequisites to research.},

@book{AmericanStatisticalAssociation2016,
abstract = {The American Statistical Association (ASA) funded the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) Project, which consists of two groups, one focused on K–12 education and one focused on introductory college courses. This re- port presents the recommendations developed by the college group. The report includes a brief history of the introductory college course and summarizes the 1992 report1 by George Cobb that has been considered a generally accepted set of recommendations for teaching these courses. Results of a survey on the teaching of intro- ductory courses are summarized, along with a description of current versions of introductory statistics courses. We then offer a list of goals for students, based on what it means to be statistically literate. We present six recommendations for the teaching of introductory statistics that build on the previous recommendations from Cobb's report. Our six recommendations include the following: 1. Emphasize statistical literacy and develop statistical thinking 2. Use real data 3. Stress conceptual understanding, rather than mere knowledge of procedures 4. Foster active learning in the classroom 5. Use technology for developing conceptual understanding and analyzing data 6. Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning The report concludes with suggestions for how to make these changes and includes numerous examples in the appendices to illus- trate details of the recommendations.},

- More students are taking intro to stats (34.7{\%} increase), stat majors has grown 140{\%} from 2003 to 2013
- rapid increase in available data - teachers should utilize this to prepare students for modern statistical analysis
- better technology for education - R
* Recommendation 3: integrating real data sets: "Statistics can be thought of as the science of learning from data, so the context of the data becomes an integral part of the problem-solving experience."
- R allows students to do easily carry out an analysis of a relevant data set which can make the course more interesting},
