abstract = {The American Statistical Association (ASA) funded the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) Project, which consists of two groups, one focused on K–12 education and one focused on introductory college courses. This re- port presents the recommendations developed by the college group. The report includes a brief history of the introductory college course and summarizes the 1992 report1 by George Cobb that has been considered a generally accepted set of recommendations for teaching these courses. Results of a survey on the teaching of intro- ductory courses are summarized, along with a description of current versions of introductory statistics courses. We then offer a list of goals for students, based on what it means to be statistically literate. We present six recommendations for the teaching of introductory statistics that build on the previous recommendations from Cobb's report. Our six recommendations include the following: 1. Emphasize statistical literacy and develop statistical thinking 2. Use real data 3. Stress conceptual understanding, rather than mere knowledge of procedures 4. Foster active learning in the classroom 5. Use technology for developing conceptual understanding and analyzing data 6. Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning The report concludes with suggestions for how to make these changes and includes numerous examples in the appendices to illus- trate details of the recommendations.},
annote = {* Changes since the 2005 report:
- More students are taking intro to stats (34.7{\%} increase), stat majors has grown 140{\%} from 2003 to 2013
- rapid increase in available data - teachers should utilize this to prepare students for modern statistical analysis
- better technology for education - R
* Recommendation 3: integrating real data sets: "Statistics can be thought of as the science of learning from data, so the context of the data becomes an integral part of the problem-solving experience."
- R allows students to do easily carry out an analysis of a relevant data set which can make the course more interesting

- new benchmarks for intro stats- need to use software to meet these},

abstract = {Nolan and Temple Lang argue that "the ability to express statistical computations is an essential skill." A key related capacity is the ability to conduct and present data analysis in a way that another person can understand and replicate. The copy-and-paste workflow that is an artifact of antiquated user-interface design makes reproducibility of statistical analysis more difficult, especially as data become increasingly complex and statistical methods become increasingly sophisticated. R Markdown is a new technology that makes creating fully-reproducible statistical analysis simple and painless. It provides a solution suitable not only for cutting edge research, but also for use in an introductory statistics course. We present evidence that R Markdown can be used effectively in introductory statistics courses, and discuss its role in the rapidly-changing world of statistical computation.},

abstract = {Interactive platforms for learning computer programming have exploded in recent years. Sadly, the R programming language is overlooked by most of these tools. swirl is an open source software package for the R programming language that allows users to learn R and statistics interactively, right in the R console. swirl supports multiple questions types, but emphasis is on having the user interact directly with the R prompt, while receiving helpful and immediate feedback. We (swirl's creators) have pioneered early content creation, but swirl is constructed in such a way that anyone can create his or her own content and share it freely with others. While swirl has been downloaded over 70,000 times in its first nine months, development of the software and instructional content is ongoing. We hope that the R and statistics communities will continue to rally around the platform and truly embrace it as their own.},

abstract = {Technology plays a critical role in supporting statistics education, and student comprehension is improved when simulations accompanied by dynamic visualizations are employed. Many web-based teaching tool applets programmed in Java/Javascript are publicly available (e.g., www.rossmanchance.com, www.socr.ucla.edu). These provide a user-friendly interface which is accessible and appealing to students in introductory statistics courses. However, not all statistics educators are fluent in Java/Javascript and may not be able to tailor these apps or develop their own. Shiny, a web application framework for R created by RStudio, facilitates applet development for educators who are familiar with R. We illustrate the utility, convenience, and versatility of Shiny through our collection of 17 freely available apps covering a range of topics and levels (found at www.statistics.calpoly.edu/shiny). Our Shiny source code is publicly available so that anyone may tailor our apps as desired. We provide feedback on how our apps have been used in statistics classes including some challenges that were encountered. We also discuss feasibility on building, launching, and deploying Shiny apps. A brief tutorial on installing and using Shiny is provided in the appendix. Some teaching materials based on our Shiny apps are also included in the appendix.},

@article{Hardin2015,
abstract = {A growing number of students are completing undergraduate degrees in statistics and entering the workforce as data analysts. In these positions, they are expected to understand how to utilize databases and other data warehouses, scrape data from Internet sources, program solutions to complex problems in multiple languages, and think algorithmically as well as statistically. These data science topics have not traditionally been a major component of undergraduate programs in statistics. Consequently, a curricular shift is needed to address additional learning outcomes. The goal of this paper is to motivate the importance of data science proficiency and to provide examples and resources for instructors to implement data science in their own statistics curricula. We provide case studies from seven institutions. These varied approaches to teaching data science demonstrate curricular innovations to address new needs. Also included here are examples of assignments designed for courses that foster engaging of undergraduates with data and data science.},

abstract = {AbstractModular programming is a development paradigm that emphasizes self-contained, flexible, and independent pieces of functionality. This practice allows new features to be seamlessly added when desired, and unwanted features to be removed, thus simplifying the user-facing view of the software. The recent rise of web-based software applications has presented new challenges for designing an extensible, modular software system. In this paper, we outline a framework for designing such a system, with a focus on reproducibility of the results. We present as a case study a Shiny-based web application called intRo, that allows the user to perform basic data analyses and statistical routines. Finally, we highlight some challenges we encountered, and how to address them, when combining modular programming concepts with reactive programming as used by Shiny.},

abstract = {Statistics students need to develop the capacity to make sense of the staggering amount of information collected in our increasingly data-centered world. Data science is an important part of modern statistics, but our introductory and second statistics courses often neglect this fact. This paper discusses ways to provide a practical foundation for students to learn to "compute with data" as defined by Nolan and Temple Lang (2010), as well as develop "data habits of mind" (Finzer, 2013). We describe how introductory and second courses can integrate two key precursors to data science: the use of reproducible analysis tools and access to large databases. By introducing students to commonplace tools for data management, visualization, and reproducible analysis in data science and applying these to real-world scenarios, we prepare them to think statistically in the era of big data.},

annote = {- Why technology should be integraged into introductory stats (they use 2 articles in blue)

- outlines a R Markdown lesson (with mosaic) for 1st week of class to expose students to real data and software. 

- They would advocate the use of these things, while other educators might want to teach stats with other functionalities of R. There is no one 'right way' to incorporate R in an intro statistics class but DataCamp allows educators to use what they think is best.

- intoducing this early will help lessen anxiety for new R users

- recomend using mosaic()

- For large classes, this is not feasible. Yes having a lot of in-person assistance is great but a lot of the time you don't have the resources. DataCamp allows you to customize automated feedback. When a student submits an incorrect answer, the system will tell the student what they are doing wrong. You can customize this message to give students little hints toward the correct answer or tell them what the right answer is.},
